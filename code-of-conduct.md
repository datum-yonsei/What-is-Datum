_We put together this manual for Datum Academia at Yonsei University. We are making it public to provide insight into DATUM to members, mentors, project partners, and anyone else interested._
 
Welcome to the Datum Academia program! We hope your experience will help you grow your skills as a data scientist as well as help you learn how to apply those skills to solve real-world problems.

This code of conduct outlines our goals in running this Academia, our hopes for your experience, and our expectations of the participants. Additionally, we’ve outlined what you can expect from us and the basic structure of the program.

One of the things that makes the DATUM different is that it's largely self-directed. This means you won't have someone telling you what to do, learn, etc, while you're here (though we do have a few social rules). This self-directedness is baked into the core structure of the DATUM. It comes from our belief that people learn best when given the freedom to explore what most interests them.

# Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct applies to all participants in all of our events open to external partners and the public, as well as to the Academia itself. We hope that these things go without saying. We want to ensure that everyone who comes into the DATUM space to feel welcome, and we want to foster a safe, productive environment for members, staff, and visitors.

Our Anti-Harassment Policy (below) explicitly outlines the behavior for which we have a zero tolerance policy. If you feel that you or anyone else is being harassed or treated unfairly, or have any other concerns about this policy, please contact us. 

## Anti-Harassment Policy

Datum is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience in all event venues, including talks, parties, and online media, for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion, the use or display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Penalty

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately and may be sanctioned or expelled from the fellowship or fellowship events at the discretion of the organizers. Organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the academia. DATUM will follow Yonsei guidelines and refer to external means of resolutions if possible. 
If you feel anyone has violated this policy, please bring it up directly with the individual or with a DATUM staff member.
If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the staff team with a concise description of your grievance; all grievances will be considered.


# Goals of the Academia
There are two main goals for this program. We know that these are lofty goals. We do not pretend to know the optimal way to achieve them, but we think it’s worth trying. We expect all of you to help us improving our program so we can achieve these goals more effectively. Our two goals (in order of priority) are:

** 1.	Exploring Topics of Data Science **
** 2.	Building a Community of Data Scientists **

## Exploring Topics of Data Science
This is our number one priority. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing, which is why you will work in teams to explore a topic of data science. Over the course of the Academia, you will gain hands-on experience not only with data science and technical skills, but also working collaboratively on a data science team, developing solutions in an agile way, and communicating your work effectively to technical and non-technical audiences.

## We start the summer off with a week of orientation, making sure everyone is:
•	familiar with the goals of the program and what to expect
•	getting to know each other better
•	up to speed on the tools and approaches we will use throughout the Academia

We also provide ongoing training through lectures and workshops every two week throughout the summer. This will include both training sessions on technical skills required for every data science and sessions on concepts and skills required to work within the realm of social good. 

In short, we want the Academia to be a productive and collaborative experience for you where you learn by working on real projects. We will support you with many types of resources for the summer. The biggest resource, however, are the other members in your cohort. Every members brings their own experience and expertise, and we aim to foster a learning environment where everyone can share their knowledge and learn from one another.

## Building a Community of Datum

We hope (and expect) that your impact as a DATUM alum continues beyond. Whether it’s continuing to collaborate with your colleagues on other projects, joining the data team of a government agency, or working to recruit other like-minded people to apply their in-demand data science skills to impactful problems, we hope that this is just the beginning of your tenure as a data scientist for social good.

# Our Hopes for Your Experience

The Academia provides you with the opportunity to learn, work on challenging, exciting, and unique projects, and meet a lot of people with shared interests and goals. It is up to you to make sure you take advantage of these opportunities.
We hope you might use the summer to:

•	Learn about the challenges of data scientists
•	Navigate the triangle between data and tech heavy work, deliverables that are actionable for your project partner, and the skills that you and your team bring to the table
•	Rise to the challenge of working on a strong team with diverse experiences and strengths
•	Embrace your own shortcomings as learning opportunities, exploring your limitations with respect to technical skills, new types of methods from different disciplines, project management, social issues, and teamwork
•	Explore available roles in this field and find the one you are best suited to fill (or create a new one)
•	Meet a group of members and project partners who have a wide variety of different skills and experiences; listen to and learn from them; and make new friends

Throughout the Academia, we encourage you to share your ideas about how to improve the experience for yourself and others. We are constantly trying to improve the program every day as we learn from each cohort.

## Eligibility
In order to be considered eligible to become a member in the Academia, these are the requirements 
1.	Attend the summer seminar of Beginner Python and Data Science 
a.	Attend more than 80% of the summer seminar
2.	Attend weekly meetings 
a.	Attend more than 80% of the weekly meetings 
b.	The bi-weekly coding workshop will count as extra-credit towards your participations. 

# Our Expectations of Members
The program offers a lot of freedom to explore and learn, and some of your routines and responsibilities will project-specific; however, we expect all members to stick to the basic principles listed below at all times. The same principles apply to everybody else at the program, including mentors, project managers, and the program organizers. If you feel that anyone is not behaving in accordance with these guidelines, we invite you to bring it up constructively. If you are unsure who to address, or if you are uncomfortable doing so directly, you can bring up your concerns or suggestions.
Be supportive, open-minded, and willing to compromise.

•	DATUM brings together members and partners from different backgrounds and with different skills. In fact, this might be the best resource the program has to offer! Share your knowledge and your experience with each other. Be patient as you teach each other and have an open ear for your peers.
•	Things might not go as you thought they would. It is natural that at times you may be disappointed or unhappy with your team members, mentors, project partner, or the program as a whole; similarly, there will be times when someone else feels that way toward you. Keep an open mind, communicate with everybody involved, and compromise. Neither your project, nor your team, nor the program will be perfect. Remember that everyone involved has invested a lot in the program and want all participants to be happy.
Be professional. We expect you to be professional — that is, respectful, friendly, and on time — in your conduct with partners and the public alike.
Be resourceful and pragmatic. Own your own learning. Seek out resources as necessary. Don't be shy to ask others for help, but also be mindful of their time. When you notice problems or have ideas for improvements — be it in your team, your project, or the program — don’t rely on others to fix them; offer your initiative.
Deal with conflicts maturely. There are many potential sources of conflict throughout the program— so it is perfectly acceptable and expected that you might run into conflicts with your team, your mentors, your project, or the academia organizers. In any case, we ask you to be productive, pragmatic, and mature when dealing with conflicts. We have listed some of the resources available to you when working through them below.
Show up. We have all committed to be here for the duration of the program. However, we recognize that you have a life and may have attendance conflicts. If you have any known or potential absences, you must tell DATUM staff upon your acceptance. Any additional attendance conflicts that might arise must be discussed and agreed upon by your team and project manager well ahead of time.
Stay involved and act as a steward. As a member of the DATUM community, we expect a commitment from you to stay involved. We ask you to seek opportunities to present the work you did, whether it's at your university, company, or social good and technology events near you. We ask you to assist your team in writing publications about your project, both during and after the academia.  We will ask you to help us with the application process in the following years by reviewing applications and interviewing candidates. We ask that you do what you're able to contribute to the DATUM mission and community.
 
** DON'T PANIC **
Regardless of how much experience you have, we admitted you because we believe that you can make a valuable contribution to your cohort, and we think being a DATUM member will help prepare you to do data science in the real world. We've made a commitment to you and want to do everything we can to help you succeed. This is really important, so we'll say it again, in bold: If you're reading this, you are here because we want you to be here and believe that you are ready to make an impact. For example, don't worry about how much more or less productive, knowledgeable, or experienced other members in your cohort might appear to be. It's easy to only see the people who are doing particularly well, even though in reality, everybody has more and less productive times.
 
# The Environment

## The People

The foundation of any good project is a good team. We’ve worked to recruit and hand pick a passionate and skilled team of interdisciplinary folks that all bring unique skills to your cohort.
While the exact numbers vary by project and by year, we aim to admit as many as Members as we can. 
Your team will be assigned a Mentor. Each Mentor will be working with three Members, supporting their growth and project. All mentors will oversee your project and work to serve as a resource for you through the project development process. 
In addition to Mentors, you will have a Project Manager. Project Manager oversees the teams and is responsible for managing your relationship with your project partner. They work with you and your partner to set goals and deadlines, they ensure proper communication between your team and your partner, and they help tackle issues that are blocking your success. Your Project Manager is also a great resource when you have questions about organizing team work, improving presentation skills, and communicating with the public. To become a Mentor, you must have completed a year of Academia and be willing to become a Mentor.

The Academia Organizers have spent months planning and preparing the program They select members, mentors, project managers, interns, and project partners, find a space, secure funding, prepare the summer’s curriculum, and plan all program events. Over the summer, they will lead some of the activities and teach some of the workshops. They also supervise the mentors, project managers, interns, and the communications manager. 
The Learning

Our goal is for you to learn a LOT this summer. We want you to feel empowered to drive your education throughout the summer. We see learning opportunities falling into three main buckets:
•	Self-Directed Learning: We will share specific resources and guidelines for topics that we find useful in order to kick-start this learning process. We then encourage you to dive in and learn the skills most applicable to you and your growth.
•	Peer-Directed Learning: We aim to create an environment that facilitates learning among members. Whether it’s an informal discussion over lunch or a more formal teaching session, we encourage you to take advantage of the diversity of experiences and skills in the room.
•	Member-Directed Learning: Lastly, we have developed few specific workshop curriculum to cover basic concepts that we believe are essential for the program.
As stated previously, it is up to you to make sure you are seeking the resources you need to learn the skills you want to learn. That being said, if you are lost, speak up. You shouldn't feel that you are unable to make a meaningful contribution to your project. 
In all of this, we recognize that there is no definitive curriculum or roadmap. We are charting new territory and developing it together. Throughout the program, there will be plenty of opportunities for feedback and brainstorming on how to improve learning.

## The Tools
We typically use GitHub for storing our codebase, KakaoTalk for communication, and Google Drive for project management. We also store team-wide documents on Google Drive

## The Communication
Teams will work together to develop specific team norms. Teams will have weekly conference calls with their project partner to provide updates, ask questions, and receive feedback on their progress.

## The Fun
While this is an academia— and we expect you to treat it as such — we would hate for it to be all work and no play. We want to help foster a community among your cohort.

## Workflow
We get a lot of questions about what to expect in terms of the program. While the specific timing will vary by project, below is the general plan most projects will follow.

## Learning about Projects and Partners
After orientation, you will spend the first part of the program getting to know your project partner and their challenges. While the project will have been initially scoped, you will have the opportunity to refine that scope by working with your project partner throughout the summer. For example, we may have initially worked with a project partner to determine a goal of finding how it pertains to the technology management field. Your team would then work with the partner to narrow that to a thesis of liking.

# Working on Your Project
You will have the opportunity to explore a certain topic in the Technology Management field and to write a dissertation about the topic. You will be responsible for all of the following:
•	Explore your data
•	Design your project workflow
•	Build relevant models
•	Improve feature and pipeline engineering
•	Evaluate using the metrics that make sense for your project
•	Develop additional final deliverables if needed. (API, dashboard applications, etc)

# Presentations
We believe that our work is only useful if we are able to communicate about it with our partners, peers, as well as the general public. As such, an important piece of this training program is learning to present about the work you do.
Each week, a member of your team will give a 2-3 minute update to the entire members outlining your progress to date and the work you aim to complete the following week. Once every month, your team will present a 7-minute deep dive, outlining the more technical components of your project and seeking feedback from other members and mentors.
At the end of project, your team will develop a final polished 15-minute presentation for the final DATUM event. 

# A Typical Week
We are often asked what typical schedule of DATUM member looks like. To get a better sense of what to expect, take a look at a sample schedule below. This is a rough schedule so don't take it too literally - we've created it to give an idea of what the Academia roughly looks like.
Datum is a yearly segmented Academia focused on studying Data Science! 
Here is the basic outline of our activity. 

During the Summer Vacation: 
•	Membership Training (One night two days)
•	Learning Python from Codecademy
•	Learning the basics of Data Science 
•	Meeting once every week to develop your programming skills 

During Semester 2: 
•	Day of orientation
•	Meeting once every week 
•	Meeting with advisor 
•	Self-directed work
•	Studying Data Science & Python 

During Winter Vacation 
•	Competitions 
•	Presenting your progress 
•	Studying Data Science & Python and finding your niche 

During Semester 1: 
•	Working a real case & creating your own case 
•	Certificates studies (Python Certificates, Computer User in Field of Spreadsheet and Database)
 
## Advice
If you're relatively new to programming
•	Choose a language and stick to it. Python or Ruby is probably best; JavaScript and many others are also ok.
•	Choose a text editor that is easy to learn and stick to it. If you're not sure which one to choose, Sublime Text is powerful, intuitive, and available on Mac, Windows and Linux.
•	Avoid large frameworks like Rails and Django until you've got a decent grasp on the language you're using.
•	Write lots of code. The specific code you write is less important than that you write lots of code.
•	Don't worry about choosing the "perfect" project. It's easy to let the perfect be the enemy of the good when it comes to project selection.
•	Have your code reviewed regularly, ideally by someone who knows the language you're working in well.
•	Pair program, ideally with people who know the language you're working in well.
•	Develop a good mental model of your code.
•	Become a systematic debugger. That is to say, debug by gathering information, making a hypothesis about what's wrong, and testing your hypothesis, as opposed to just changing things until it works.
•	Write small programs from scratch.
•	 åBecome comfortable with your tools, but don't go overboard yak-shaving. Learn to use git, GitHub, a text editor and your language's debugger.
•	Avoid distractions.
